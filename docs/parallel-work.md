# Parallel Work

The [coordination issue](https://github.com/DeandreT/ferrule/issues/89) tracks
bounded work from the [roadmap](../ROADMAP.md). Issues define the problem,
in/out of scope, likely files and acceptance checks; this page helps contributors
choose a lane and avoid conflicting changes.

## Current Basic milestone handoffs (2026-10-14)

[#697](https://github.com/DeandreT/ferrule/issues/697) coordinates the
[current roadmap](../ROADMAP.md#current-basic-ownership-milestone-2026-10-14)
against merged main [`d92a0bb`](https://github.com/DeandreT/ferrule/commit/d92a0bb67826d13fc3069c9b7c0acad85f7c4073).
Sort profiles and the retained PR705 48-outcome cohort are merged. The separate
singleton runtime corrections are merged in PR712 and PR716. Their local checks
and current C05/nested18/alias9/filter36 comparisons passed within their finite
scopes. PR718 merged the common window profile after 448 local tests passed;
separate backend window implementation is next. Earlier dated tables retain
their historical scope. Source review, local execution and matched outcomes
remain separate evidence.

| Lane | Source ownership | Next gate |
| --- | --- | --- |
| #693 Rust singleton projection | `crates/codegen-runtime/src/context/basic.rs` and `basic_tests.rs`. | Merged in PR712. Current runtime375/backend164-active-plus-ten-ignored and filter24/sort26 checks passed. Bind the merged runtime preimages at #702's handoff; do not reuse older runtime source identities. |
| #694 C# singleton projection | `runtime/csharp/Ferrule.Runtime/ScopeContext.cs` and `Ferrule.Runtime.SmokeTests/BasicOwnershipContextTests.cs`. | Merged in PR716. Backend164/strict and all 45 runtime/generated commands passed, including smoke216/public44/new-singleton33. Bind the fresh runtime source and DLL at #703's handoff. |
| #688/#692 nested-context qualification | Focused conformance fixtures and complete output/error oracles. | Current C05 six-call comparison passed. The original six-model/18-call cohort is accepted after retained-capture reconciliation: four C05 expected strings changed in memory, no execution replay and original failures/fixtures preserved. Broader error and observer qualification remains separate. |
| #677 alias/filter cohorts | Original alias and filter models; no production edits. | Current alias9 and filter36 passed after both fixes, with all ten alias and 16 filter commands passing. Broader nested and matched-sort claims retain separate gates. |
| #698 common windows | Common `lib.rs`, `lower.rs`, `owned_admission.rs`, `validate/mod.rs`, `validate/owned_sources.rs`, `tests/basic_owned_emission.rs`, `tests/owned_admission.rs`. | Merged in PR718 after all four local commands passed, including 448 tests/Basic40/admission32, production and strict checks. The separate backend window handoff is ready. |
| #702 Rust windows / #703 C# windows | Separate backend renderer, entrypoint and test scopes; each owns its language runtime files after the #693/#694 handoff. | Planned implementation is authorized after merged #698. Use the merged singleton runtime preimages, then qualify bounds, both filter/sort orders, First, typed failures and finite generated consumers separately. |
| #704 matched windows | One focused portable window corpus; no production edits. | Follow both qualified backend window merges. Preserve earlier sort and nested-context evidence. |
| #709 CJK font fallback | GUI `main.rs`, new `fonts.rs` and one pinned regular font with OFL/copyright/provenance assets. | Source accepted; local font tests, production and private-display checks are unrun. Preserve Latin/Greek primary fonts and the separate Lucide family; rerun failed C02 after qualification. |
| #406 compact GUI workflows | Current GUI build/tests and alternate-display desktop workflows. | Six of nine workflows passed; C02 failed on CJK glyphs. C03 named hover/accessibility and C06 target-height/pin-edge evidence remain unverified. C09 passed protected186, two normal exits and full source guards. |
| #612/#613/#606 broader acceptance | Claim each remaining engine/host scope separately. | Matched finite cohorts inform acceptance; public observer activation requires its own checks. |

Solid arrows identify implementation prerequisites or file handoffs; dotted
arrows supply finite qualification evidence. Font and desktop work are separate
from common/backend window source scopes. Shared compilation and artifact access
still use one coordinated verification slot.

- [x] Merge sort profiles, the earlier #670 cohort and separate #693/#694 fixes.
- [x] Qualify current C05/nested18/alias9/filter36 against both runtime corrections.
- [x] Verify #698's common window candidate locally with all 448 tests.
- [x] Merge #698's verified common window profile in PR718.
- [ ] Implement separate #702/#703 increments, then qualify #704's cohort.
- [ ] Qualify #709, rerun C02 and complete C03/C06 desktop evidence.
- [ ] Complete broader Basic acceptance before public observer activation.

Merge focused increments after their appropriate local checks without waiting
for CI. Keep failed captures, earlier cohorts and their source identities distinct.

## Current Basic ownership handoffs (2026-10-13)

This [#679](https://github.com/DeandreT/ferrule/issues/679) snapshot records
published main [`23b6167`](https://github.com/DeandreT/ferrule/commit/23b6167895c832b30631289f201ba0bd6e8f2990).
The [current roadmap](../ROADMAP.md#current-basic-ownership-progress-2026-10-13)
records merged common/Rust/C# filters, the finite #662 corpus and native sort
observations. Earlier dated sections and the original #640 outcomes retain their
historical scope. Generated error scope is unknown/unavailable; full filter,
error and total parity remain incomplete.

| Qualified milestone | Completed local checks |
| --- | --- |
| #657/PR661 common filter admission | 423 common tests / 23 admission controls, production and strict. |
| #644/PR663 Rust filters | 357 runtime tests; 158 Rust tests with nine ignored; 14 generated programs / 24 calls, production and strict. |
| #645/PR674 C# filters | 155 backend tests / 77 owned controls; fresh Runtime95; 216 smoke controls / 16 public calls across eight hosts, production and strict. |
| #662/PR678 matched filters | Six models / 36 complete outcomes, 12 per executor; all 16 build/run steps passed. The named legacy path gap remains outside this corrected corpus. |
| #673/PR675 native sort observations | 521 engine tests / 65 trace controls, production and strict. Lifecycle CLI7/GUI28 qualification remains scoped to #654/PR660. |

All current issues below are assigned to `DeandreT`. Source plans do not grant
execution or merge credit. Agree the preimages and released file ownership before
editing; a dependency may allow independent preparation while still blocking
qualification or publication.

| Lane | Source ownership | Handoff and next gate |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [#667 Common sort profile](https://github.com/DeandreT/ferrule/issues/667) | Common `lib.rs`, `lower.rs`, `owned_admission.rs`, `validate/mod.rs`, `validate/owned_sources.rs`, `tests/basic_owned_emission.rs`, `tests/owned_admission.rs`. | Active after matched #662. Add explicit sort APIs; default/filter-only behavior and closed families remain unchanged. Merge before backend sort qualification. |
| [#668 Rust sorting](https://github.com/DeandreT/ferrule/issues/668) | Rust backend `lib.rs`, `owned_basic.rs`, `tests/owned_basic.rs`; runtime `context/basic.rs`, `basic_tests.rs`. | Depends on #667. May proceed in parallel with #669; coordinate runtime-file handoff with #680. Qualify complete bounded sort/filter orders and a finite generated driver. |
| [#669 C# sorting](https://github.com/DeandreT/ferrule/issues/669) | C# backend `lib.rs`, `owned_basic.rs`, `mapping.rs`, `tests/owned_basic.rs`; runtime `ScopeContext.cs`, `BasicOwnershipContextTests.cs`. | Depends on #667. May proceed in parallel with #668; coordinate runtime/backend-test handoff with #681. Fresh runtime and generated consumers precede merge. |
| [#670 Matched sorting](https://github.com/DeandreT/ferrule/issues/670) | Nine new files under `conformance/basic-owned-sort/`; no production/runtime edits. | After #667/#668/#669 merge, freeze and qualify the planned 16-case/48-call cohort. Preserve occurrence/filter corpora and failed captures. |
| [#676 Native window observations](https://github.com/DeandreT/ferrule/issues/676) | Engine `eval_scope.rs` and `tests/trace.rs` only. | Active after #673. Report WindowApplied using the actual receiving parent context and logical First count; preserve output, error and budget order. No generated window or public observer activation. |
| [#677 Named legacy-path probe](https://github.com/DeandreT/ferrule/issues/677) | Focused matched probe; retain the original model/input/outcomes. | Run nine selected-Named calls across owner-relative, prefixed and empty paths in all three executors before choosing a production fix. Probe qualification is pending. |
| [#680 Rust alias child](https://github.com/DeandreT/ferrule/issues/680) | Runtime `context/basic.rs` and `basic_tests.rs` only. | Preparation only until #677's probe confirms the gap. Preserve default traversal, ownership, phases, limits and first errors; sequence overlapping #668 runtime edits. |
| [#681 C# alias child](https://github.com/DeandreT/ferrule/issues/681) | Runtime `ScopeContext.cs`, `BasicOwnershipContextTests.cs`; narrow paired-position control in C# `tests/owned_basic.rs`. | Preparation only until the probe confirms the gap. Preserve the original negative helper/model, rebuild the runtime and sequence overlapping #669 files. |
| [#606 Observers and acceptance](https://github.com/DeandreT/ferrule/issues/606) | Claim each remaining engine/host scope separately. | Lifecycle, candidate, filter and sort observations are merged. Window/error/debug/cancellation observers, public activation and broader #612/#613 acceptance retain independent checks. |

Solid arrows are prerequisites; dotted arrows provide finite qualification
evidence. They do not imply that broader acceptance or public observer activation
is complete. The editable [architecture drawing](architecture-parity.drawio)
retains the broader design and is unchanged.

- [x] Merge #644/#645 and qualify #662's 36 matched filter calls.
- [x] Merge #673's native sort observations; preserve closed public trace/debug gates.
- [ ] Hand common sort ownership from #667 to separate #668/#669 owners, then
  qualify #670. Keep generated windows/grouping and specialized families closed.
- [ ] Qualify #676 native windows and #677's probe, separate #680/#681 fixes and
  subsequent alias/filter rerun. Preserve failed captures and original models.
- [ ] Complete #612/#613 and #606's remaining acceptance checks before activation.

Reserve one shared compiler/artifact lane, check disk headroom, and bind each local
check to current sources and runtime artifacts. Rust and C# source scopes may
proceed in parallel; overlapping backend/runtime edits and engine window/error
work require a handoff. Merge locally verified focused increments without waiting
for CI. Graphical checks use an alternate display. This docs issue owns only the
two current fronts; it changes no runtime or admission capability.

## Current public native ownership lanes (2026-10-13)

This [#624](https://github.com/DeandreT/ferrule/issues/624) snapshot is against
merged main [`80274d0`](https://github.com/DeandreT/ferrule/commit/80274d0079f0adbe70004780701c7bf1cbbe0280),
including [PR618](https://github.com/DeandreT/ferrule/pull/618),
[PR625](https://github.com/DeandreT/ferrule/pull/625),
[PR626](https://github.com/DeandreT/ferrule/pull/626) and
[PR628](https://github.com/DeandreT/ferrule/pull/628). The
[current roadmap](../ROADMAP.md#current-public-native-ownership-2026-10-13)
records the public Basic root/scoped-walk and occurrence-position implementation.
Owned global failure rules, tracing and debugging remain closed; specialized
ownership domains retain their separate gates. #620's explicit nonrepeating
root pins, #621's caller-owned scalar function arguments and #623's Basic owned
scalar construction are merged in PR625, PR626 and PR628. PR628's native
verification passed all 437 engine library tests, including the exact 35-test
core module, 18 source-ownership tests and 31 owned Basic tests. Production
compilation and strict library/test checks also passed. Earlier PR625/PR626
results retain their own increment scopes. Matched generated qualification and
the remaining occurrence, failure and observer work are pending. The planned
18 matched native/Rust/C# calls remain unrun.

[PR619](https://github.com/DeandreT/ferrule/pull/619) is closed without merging
because PR618 superseded its private root executor. Its retained 407-test result
qualifies only the older private proposal.
[#616](https://github.com/DeandreT/ferrule/issues/616) is closed as not planned:
the public executor has no retained success-witness log. Candidate/ancestry
metadata and large-input memory behavior belong to #622.

The active lanes are assigned to `DeandreT`. Coordinate a source handoff before
changing shared files; they are unavailable for a new independent claim. The
older tables and diagrams below remain dated snapshots.

| Lane | Source scope and required handoff | Current status and next gate |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [#620 Explicit nonrepeating root pins](https://github.com/DeandreT/ferrule/issues/620) | `crates/engine/src/owned_context.rs` and `tests/owned_source_basic.rs`; hand off walker changes to #622. | Merged in [PR625](https://github.com/DeandreT/ferrule/pull/625); #620 is closed as completed. Native checks passed: 422 engine library tests, including 31 owned Basic tests, production compilation and strict library/test checks. Exact-owner repeating/inactive-frame distinctions are preserved. #623's prerequisite is satisfied. |
| [#621 Caller-owned scalar function arguments](https://github.com/DeandreT/ferrule/issues/621) | `crates/engine/src/source_ownership.rs` and `tests/source_ownership.rs`; hand shared admission files to #623, then #613. | Merged in [PR626](https://github.com/DeandreT/ferrule/pull/626); #621 is closed as completed. Native checks passed: 429 engine library tests, including the exact 18-test source-ownership module, production compilation and strict library/test checks. Arguments retain caller context; the body remains isolated and inherited specialized contexts retain their refusals. |
| [#622 Large-input candidate metadata](https://github.com/DeandreT/ferrule/issues/622) | Owned walking in `owned_context.rs`, phase storage in `eval_scope.rs`, and focused performance controls; coordinate #620's walker and #623's scope edits. | Measurements remain unrun. Measure retained metadata across First, filters, sorting and windows; bound actual retention with typed limits, then stream eligible paths. Preserve complete outputs and Structural/Selection/Output positions. Keep measurements with the focused implementation increments. |
| [#623 Basic scalar target construction](https://github.com/DeandreT/ferrule/issues/623) | Scalar admission in `source_ownership.rs`, routing in `eval_scope.rs`, and focused tests; hand shared admission files to #613's root-only #627 increment. | Merged in [PR628](https://github.com/DeandreT/ferrule/pull/628); #623 is closed as completed. Native checks passed: 437 engine library tests, including the exact 35-test core module, production compilation and strict library/test checks. The existing constructor/conversion path and specialized refusals are preserved. |
| [#613 Global failure rules and row provenance](https://github.com/DeandreT/ferrule/issues/613) | Root-only #627 owns `failure.rs`, `tests/failure.rs`, `source_ownership.rs` and `tests/source_ownership.rs`; coordinate the admission handoff and later occurrence interface. | Assigned [#627 Static root global failures](https://github.com/DeandreT/ferrule/issues/627) source work is in progress after #623's admission handoff. Root-valued support is the first focused increment; row provenance remains closed. Preserve one stored-order pre-target pass, lazy messages and typed errors. |
| [#612 Public occurrence and phase qualification](https://github.com/DeandreT/ferrule/issues/612) | Current public walker/scope implementation and focused controls; coordinate proposed fixes with the active owner of each touched file. | Pending; the planned 18 matched native/Rust/C# calls remain unrun. Qualify nested counts, outer pins, filters, sorting, windows, bindings and child scopes with complete native/generated outcomes; include #620's root-pin correction. |
| [#606 Observer integration and final Basic acceptance](https://github.com/DeandreT/ferrule/issues/606) | Observer/admission boundaries, necessary host controls and matched execution controls; agree the context interface before independent observer source work. | Pending. Observer implementation may proceed independently; final acceptance requires confirmed matched execution, including #612 and #613. Keep unsupported domains refused. |
| [#624 Current documentation](https://github.com/DeandreT/ferrule/issues/624) | `ROADMAP.md` and `docs/parallel-work.md` only. | Reconcile current implementation/status; verify source claims, links and the diagram while preserving dated evidence and anchors. |

The solid arrow records the #620-to-#623 merge dependency, now satisfied by
PR625. Dashed
arrows identify evidence needed for final #606 acceptance; they do not serialize
independent observer implementation once its interface is agreed. #621 and #622
have distinct behavior scopes. Shared admission, walker and scope-storage files
still require sequenced edits and explicit handoffs.
Serialize shared admission source edits and handoffs in the order #621, then #623,
then #613.

- [x] PR618's public Basic roots, scoped walks and occurrence positions are
  implemented; superseded PR619 and private-only #616 are retired.
- [x] Verify and merge #620 in PR625 using its native local checks.
- [x] Verify and merge #621 in PR626 using its native local checks.
- [x] Verify and merge #623 in PR628 using its native local checks, then hand
  shared admission files to #613's root-only #627 increment.
- [ ] Measure and bound #622 candidate metadata within its implementation work;
  measurements remain unrun. Preserve required materialization and position phases.
- [ ] Qualify #612/#613 against actual public execution and matched generated
  controls, then settle #606 observer behavior and final Basic acceptance.

Reserve shared compiler/artifact capacity before local checks. Reuse compatible
build artifacts, retain exact source/executable identities and check disk
headroom; avoid duplicate caches and concurrent heavy builds. Run graphical
checks on an alternate display. Source review, local execution and physical
workflow evidence remain separate gates. Historical private checks do not
supply current-main qualification.

## Claim a lane

1. Read the issue and its linked contracts. Check current assignees and comments;
   the table below is a snapshot, not a replacement for the live issue.
2. Assign the issue to yourself before starting. Maintainer work is assigned to
   `DeandreT`; an unassigned `help wanted` issue is available. If you cannot set
   an assignee, ask the maintainer to assign you in the issue before proceeding.
3. State the files or modules you plan to own and any shared verification slot
   you will need. Agree on overlapping edits before changing the same source.
4. Keep one bounded result per PR and link its issue. For a newly discovered
   gap, open a scoped issue before implementing it; do not silently widen the
   issue you claimed.
5. Leave concise updates in first person (I/me): result, evidence link, blocker,
   and next step. Release ownership when pausing or handing off so another
   contributor can take it.

## Basic public-family milestone and next lanes

The Rust and C# public Basic emitter families share the common source-ownership
model and admission policy. Each backend owns its renderer and language-specific
runtime integration. The
[roadmap contract](../ROADMAP.md#basic-owned-source-public-family-milestone)
describes target ValueMap, retained-input and failure boundaries.

### Source ownership

| Component | Implementation responsibility | Coordination rule |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Common admission | `crates/codegen/src/capabilities.rs` (capability set and preset table), `crates/codegen/src/validate/owned_sources/` and `crates/codegen/src/tests/basic_owned_emission.rs` | Add a new capability as its own field, table column and `owned_sources` module; agree changes to a shared gate with both backend owners. |
| Rust Basic renderer | `crates/codegen-rust/src/owned_basic.rs` and `crates/codegen-rust/src/tests/owned_basic.rs` | Sequence renderer and source-test edits within the Rust lane. |
| C# Basic renderer | `crates/codegen-csharp/src/owned_basic.rs` and `crates/codegen-csharp/src/tests/owned_basic.rs` | Sequence renderer and source-test edits within the C# lane. |
| Runtime and public interfaces | Each backend's runtime and emission entry points | Preserve each preset's capability set, generated symbols and caller contracts. |
| Documentation | Capability contracts and reusable contributor procedures | Describe implemented behavior; keep task progress, result records and handoff state in issues. |

The public Basic path validates common admission before backend rendering.
Private ordinary failure-map admission remains a separate profile from the
shared/public failure gate. A private renderer change must preserve the public
gate's complete typed refusal and the ordinary emitter's admission behavior.

Target ValueMaps retain potential input edges and runtime error priority.
Retained inventory preserves stored calls and actual referenced bodies, while
failure diagnostics retain rule, expression and source-context origins. Changes
to these contracts need coordinated source ownership even when the languages
can be implemented independently.

```mermaid

    RustRuntime --> Interfaces[Generated caller interfaces]
    CSharpRuntime --> Interfaces
```

The diagram shows shared policy prerequisites and separate backend contracts.
File ownership in the table adds serialization requirements for overlapping
changes.

### Verification and publication procedure

Reserve the shared compiler slot before builds and check available capacity.
Assign a fresh Cargo target and build directory to each attempt and source
profile. Reuse artifacts only within that profile with their retained producer
and executable identities. Source timestamps and requested manifest paths alone
do not establish the source of cached executable bytes.

Bind verification to complete source mappings and exact test inventories.
Keep source admission, generated consumer execution, physical GUI behavior and
external workflows as distinct checks. Preserve complete failure records in
the work item or local investigation evidence. Follow
[development procedures](development.md) for source isolation and owned process
closure; use an alternate display for GUI verification.

Keep each PR focused on its resulting behavior and coordinate shared-file edits
before publication. Record task status and remaining dependencies in the issue;
repository documentation describes durable behavior and procedures.

| [#538 C# checked-input bridge](https://github.com/DeandreT/ferrule/issues/538) | `crates/codegen-csharp/src/lib.rs`, `owned_basic.rs`, and `tests/owned_basic.rs` | Merged in [PR579](https://github.com/DeandreT/ferrule/pull/579). Hand these shared files to #542 for the next C# increment. |
| [#542 C# source-failure bridge](https://github.com/DeandreT/ferrule/issues/542) | C# `owned_basic.rs` and `tests/owned_basic.rs` | Merged in [PR581](https://github.com/DeandreT/ferrule/pull/581), preserving #538's checked-input path. Hand these shared files to the C# public-API owner for its next increment. |
| [#519 Rust public API](https://github.com/DeandreT/ferrule/issues/519) | Rust `lib.rs`, `owned_basic.rs`, `failure.rs`, and `tests/owned_basic.rs` | Follow the merged neutral gate and both languages' checked-input/source-rule bridge qualifications. Accepted source checks cover 17 source controls, four existing controls, strict checks, production compilation, public-symbol exposure, and test inventory. [#580](https://github.com/DeandreT/ferrule/issues/580) qualified the corrected consumer fixture; independent result acceptance covers all five external modules / 14 calls. Publication remains pending. Publish separately from C#. |
| [#519 C# public API](https://github.com/DeandreT/ferrule/issues/519) | C# `lib.rs`, `mapping.rs`, `owned_basic.rs`, and `tests/owned_basic.rs` | Follow the merged neutral gate and both languages' checked-input/source-rule bridge qualifications. Independent acceptance covers 50 source controls, strict checks, and seven external consumers / 24 calls; publication remains pending. |
| [#566 private inventory alignment](https://github.com/DeandreT/ferrule/issues/566) | Private emitter emission/catalogue files and focused tests; shared public admission gate read-only | Align the private inventory within its existing renderer scope. Future public target ValueMap support is a separate [#582](https://github.com/DeandreT/ferrule/issues/582) lane; preserve the current public refusal. |
| [#578 scoped documentation](https://github.com/DeandreT/ferrule/issues/578) | `ROADMAP.md` and `docs/parallel-work.md` | Update these two files after coordinating publication status; preserve other workstreams and historical diagrams. |

Publication prerequisites are shown below. Both languages' checked-input and
source-rule bridges need qualification and publication before either public API
is published. PR555 is merged failure groundwork; #541 remains a separate open
Rust source-rule increment. Independent public Rust source reconciliation is accepted.
The [#580](https://github.com/DeandreT/ferrule/issues/580) consumer fixture
correction in Rust `tests/owned_basic.rs` passed compilation and strict checks.
All five external modules / 14 calls now have independent result acceptance.
Coordinate that shared file with the Rust public-API owner. The earlier compile
failure remains a failed record; both public APIs remain unpublished.

- [x] Shared model/admission, both private renderer foundations, Rust failure
  groundwork, the neutral Basic gate, and both C# bridges are merged.
- [ ] Publish #537, then the separate #541 source-rule bridge.
- [x] Qualify the corrected #580 fixture with all five Rust public external
  consumer modules / 14 calls, with independent result acceptance. Retain the
  accepted C# candidate results.
- [ ] Publish the Rust and C# public APIs in separate, independently buildable PRs.

One Rust source owner should sequence #537, #541, and the Rust public API; one
C# owner should take the C# public API after merged #538 and #542.
The public language PRs can be worked on in parallel after their shared gates pass. Those backend scopes do not
own common validator files or runtime source changes. Reserve shared verification
before compiling, and verify complete current-main sources and the required test
inventory when reusing build artifacts. Keep earlier failed checks distinct from
the qualified successor.

## Current ownership and readiness

Snapshot: 2026-10-11 15:57:27 UTC, against merged main [`4e0f95d`](https://github.com/DeandreT/ferrule/commit/4e0f95de957c32e6381a1b66c5f0fe21be75da5c).
Contributor availability below retains its 15:33 UTC snapshot.
This refresh is [#417](https://github.com/DeandreT/ferrule/issues/417).
The original #89 backlog is complete. The current lanes below supersede the older
ownership snapshot for choosing new work; its evidence, counts and diagrams remain
dated history. Verify the live assignee before claiming a lane.

### Available contributor lanes

These seven issues are unassigned in this snapshot. Agree the contract and claim
the issue before implementation; availability does not bypass a dependency or
shared verification slot.

| Issue / scope | Next gate | Coordination boundary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [#103 Typed SQLite query boundary](https://github.com/DeandreT/ferrule/issues/103) | Settle the read-only query contract first. | Boundary model, SQLite and CLI input; #233 metadata inspection is a separate scope. |
| [#105 Offline mapping bundle export](https://github.com/DeandreT/ferrule/issues/105) | Settle the bundle contract first. | CLI staging, resources and path codecs. |
| [#106 JSON5 interchange metadata](https://github.com/DeandreT/ferrule/issues/106) | Observed metadata retained; executable interchange refused. | [Recorded setting and numeric incompatibilities](conformance/json5-interchange.md); no shared display is retained. |
| [#108 Mapping-path desktop workflow](https://github.com/DeandreT/ferrule/issues/108) | Qualify the existing implementation's desktop workflow. | Coordinate the desktop scenario with #92/#93. |
| [#160 C# JSON5 allocation attribution](https://github.com/DeandreT/ferrule/issues/160) | Agree a matched profiling/retention plan before attribution. | Benchmark/report only; production optimization and filesystem #107 are excluded. |
| [#347 Nested JSON Schema array wrappers](https://github.com/DeandreT/ferrule/issues/347) | Design independent wrapper representation and native/export/generated behavior first; retain the typed refusal until qualified. | Shared IR, format-json and codegen ownership must coordinate with #346. |
| [#387 Bounded input-limit fixture journals](https://github.com/DeandreT/ferrule/issues/387) | Independent design can start; code waits for #382's module to merge. | Test-only `stage_fault382.rs` journal bounds/batching; preserve all 16 frozen rows and production parser/profile behavior. |

### Maintainer lanes and publication gates

The claimed PDF isolation follow-ons under [#104](https://github.com/DeandreT/ferrule/issues/104)
are unavailable for independent claim. Active maintainer lanes remain assigned to
`DeandreT`; coordinate overlapping source and serial resources before adding work.

| Lane | Current qualification | Next gate / dependency |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [#405 / PR409](https://github.com/DeandreT/ferrule/pull/409) | Verified merged importer diagnostics | Preserve the existing importer/repair scope. |
| [#391 / PR411](https://github.com/DeandreT/ferrule/pull/411) | Verified merged scoped report: four attempted callbacks across 12 routes, 84 original records and 25 closed owners | Remaining #396/#398 dependent source/ancestry propagation. |
| [#394 / PR404](https://github.com/DeandreT/ferrule/pull/404) | Merged memory report; 31 accepted streaming controls; 70-row preparation complete once | Refreshed 140-owner resource campaign remains unrun. |
| [#346 / PR413](https://github.com/DeandreT/ferrule/issues/346) | Native A: 397 tests, including 20 new tests, passed on `9d19`; test-only successor `6534f9d` has 100 schemas/270 probes | Exact-head CI is pending; verified A merge precedes B implementation. B's accepted design has 130 calls per language. |
| [#406 / PR410](https://github.com/DeandreT/ferrule/issues/406) | Three exact-head hosted checks and 751 GUI tests pass | Required alternate-display walkthrough remains pending. |
| [#412](https://github.com/DeandreT/ferrule/issues/412) | All 15 controls/29 synthetic subcases matched once; independent review and complete evidence intake accepted | All 70 requests/140 physical owners remain unrun; fresh actor admission is required. No kernel, PDF or resource credit. |
| [#396](https://github.com/DeandreT/ferrule/issues/396) | Dependent propagation remains pending | Preserve each focused source scope and check its exact new head. |
| [#416](https://github.com/DeandreT/ferrule/issues/416) | Eighteen obsolete CSV test executables retired with complete originals retained; observed gain is about 1.14 GiB | Fresh per-actor capacity admission is still required; no build or request campaign is admitted. |

Cargo artifacts/compiler ownership, the native alternate display and same-file
edits are shared serial resources. Completed local #414/#415 cache retirements do
not establish current request/build capacity. Source-only acceptance, hosted
checks and physical workflows carry separate evidence; the survey and historical
progress denominators below are unchanged and overall compatibility is incomplete.

## Earlier ownership and readiness (2026-10-10)

Snapshot: 2026-10-10, against merged main
[`6b94863`](https://github.com/DeandreT/ferrule/commit/6b94863beebbc90f0d094e1387391131f73c5a7c).
Completed rows identify a merged increment or a qualified local prerequisite;
modeled checks remain separate from publication and physical gates. Active maintainer
lanes are assigned to `DeandreT`. Unassigned `help wanted` lanes remain available. Available does not
mean the implementation contract has already been agreed; design-first issues
settle their contract before code changes. Check the live issue for later updates.
This scoped refresh is [#349](https://github.com/DeandreT/ferrule/issues/349),
following merged [#337](https://github.com/DeandreT/ferrule/pull/337).
Rows outside the PDF/duplication refresh and the older validation/publication
observations retain the 2026-10-10 10:53:09 UTC main `0c7b2ca` snapshot date.

PDF design #329 and wire/library #334 are merged; #325 is closed. The 216 local
tests, 81 frozen wire cases, strict warnings and formatting pass; hosted
validation remains pending or unknown. #326's worker host is ongoing on
`feat/pdf-worker-host`. The primary `ResourceSetup` association is corrected.
Initial 11 worker and 52 regular CLI tests pass, alongside owned protocol,
refusal, routing, cache and signal controls. Strict-lint correction #348 and
remaining host failure controls are pending. The synthetic resource-setup
fixture does not qualify an actual resource-limit setup failure.
#344's borrowed reader follows #326; GUI filesystem cancellation #327 and
explicit preview acquisition #340 follow #344. GUI preview ownership #341
follows #327/#340. Resource qualification #328 follows #326 and does not
depend on #327; its [resource profile](performance/pdf-worker-resource-profile.md)
compares worker and in-process extraction on a finite corpus.

#309's duplication candidate passes all 753 GUI tests and strict warnings.
Its 67 native calls match 60 success and seven typed `MappingException`
expectations. All six #316 desktop phases are independently accepted with
normal closure: Main copy/original/history/context has 4/6/10/6 saved pairs;
Named copy/history and original/context has 10/9. The total is 45 complete
Project/layout pairs and 90 byte/JSON comparisons. #316 is closed; earlier
failed attempts remain retained. Native Save/reopen/Save2 and main integration
of #309 remain pending.

Earlier recorded observations follow; #271/#280 is merged.
#207/#249, #217/#251, #218/#262 and #250/#265 are merged, each with three successful
hosted jobs. All 229 selected JSON calls and #248's eight-measurement/eight-verifier/
four-decoder campaign are independently accepted. #248's bounded report is merged in
[#279](https://github.com/DeandreT/ferrule/pull/279), with three successful hosted jobs;
its samples, process counters, diagram scrolling and owned-cleanup limits remain.
#203's fixture publication #266 is merged, with all three hosted jobs successful;
24 interpreter / 51 export-refusal checks, 237 library tests and fresh combined-
main 24+51 / strict / format checks pass. #264 is closed; faithful-form admission
remains open. #261/#270 and #271/#280 are merged with three successful hosted jobs.
The issue/PR states and checks were fetched individually, not simultaneously.
#253/#277 is merged in [#278](https://github.com/DeandreT/ferrule/pull/278), with three
successful hosted jobs. Its three tests / 11 internal controls, 344 engine tests,
ordinary engine build and corrected strict/format checks retain separate evidence.
#263's older 41 simulated policy controls and #268's original 126 XML-oracle
observations (68 helper / 41 compatibility / 17 admission) are independently
accepted. Corrected #283 41+17 reruns pass; helper 68 remains inherited. The neutral
[checkpoint report](conformance/native-saved-design-reopen.md) is merged in
[#287](https://github.com/DeandreT/ferrule/pull/287), with three successful hosted jobs.
Read-only preparation passed, but native execution timed out before first save or
reopen. Later #285 diagnostics timed out, and #291's presentation experiment refused
its visible-UI requirement. All 16 modeled query controls pass. #302's correction of
the new observer exception-closure gap is source-reviewed. Three exception models match
in a completed root-owned run, now independently accepted; mocked branches
do not prove live helper/thread/cleanup closure. Fresh observer qualification and live
query/acknowledgment remain pending; the saved/reopen cycle remains unproved.
#201's 28 controls (10 admitted / 18 refused), 87 snapshots and 92 canvas tables
remain frozen. Three focused tests plan 29 duplication attempts. #298's accepted
capture compiled and formatting passed after #297 restored the locked dependency.
The first focused unit then failed at a missing test-driver wire action: the Project
used the edited source, but the canvas kept its old wire. The independently reviewed
negative retained nine primary previews, zero named previews, two duplication actions
and 19 state records; 16 of 17 reached snapshot assertions matched. #300's wire/checkpoint
driver and #301's named dispatch are separate prerequisites; their first paired
candidate's type/module-path gaps remain source refusals. The revised test-only source
is reviewed, applied and formatted; a later parent-argument refusal preceded compilation.
A fresh root-owned selected test passes all ten admitted cases and 67 local engine
previews (61 primary / six named). Independent review of those complete results is
pending in this dated snapshot. Refusal, keyboard, full GUI and two Main/Named physical
sessions with ten checkpoint pairs remain pending qualification here. Public-codec
materialization and modeled policy 29 pass separately. #288's admitted child route
retains the complete ten-case originals; later gates need fresh resource/source admission.

All three Mermaid fence bodies remain byte-exact historical views from #252 and
earlier refreshes. The table and prose below record newer lanes and dependencies;
the old graph labels are not a current status census. Earlier bounded SVG/PNG
renders retain their cleanup and zoom limits; no fresh render is claimed here.
Source review, local tests, generated calls and physical workflows retain separate
gates. Earlier zero-step billing failures remain failures; hosted execution has
resumed, and pending jobs are not passes.

Computed JSON properties retain their #110 local qualification; normal desktop
authoring remains separate. The #111/#112 precision increment merged in #120,
followed by #91 in #123, ordinary declared JSON-null matching #113 in #126, enabled
absent-default persistence #114 in #127, and typed-cell authoring #97 in #128.
Those increments preserve their distinct ordinary/isolated and persistence/UI
contracts. The original input-conversion and precision cohorts are not a claim
that every later editor workflow has desktop coverage.

The #92 ordinary flat-workbook desktop fixture is qualified in #132. The #98
primary transposed-source wizard is merged in #150 after local checks and a
separate six-phase desktop create/save/reopen workflow at 1200 × 800 / 1200 × 760.
Complete Project comparisons and saved/reopened body equality passed; workbook
execution was checked separately in local tests. Earlier collector-protocol
failures remain distinct from product behavior. Desktop workbook execution and
broader hierarchical/named setup are not claimed. Mapping-path desktop #108
remains open. Metadata lanes #93/#106 must observe
settings before changing interchange admission. #130/#163 now separately
qualify native nonfinite admission and original-byte accounting; neither observes
interchange metadata.

The #94 proposal merged in #129 with 224 independent cells: 48 Unverified,
176 Unassessed and no Supported promotion. The protected survey remains unchanged.
The source/link-reviewed #95 index and #122 numeric guide retain their earlier
rendering limitations. The four XML public-host cohorts #116–#119 are now merged;
#133/#147 records their exact gate ownership and workload-specific memory
observations in the [coverage index](generated-xml-qualification-index.md) and
[memory guide](memory-and-limits.md#compiled-xml-host-observations).
These cohorts do not establish external execution, general design coverage or a
universal RAM limit. Source reviews and emission passes remain separate from
compiled public calls.

Pure JSON5 syntax is merged in #140/#146, and the shared policy #141 with its
descriptor duplicate guard #148 is merged in #151. Explicit Rust and C#
companions are merged in #153/#155; CLI opt-in and the complete 184 small compiled
public calls are merged in #156. The 23 public cases comprise 17 representation
and six mapping/context cases, each across four routes in both languages. This
cohort is distinct from the 75-case pure syntax inventory. Ordinary strict JSON
APIs and default artifact sets stay unchanged. The complete 48 serial physical
calls in #145 are merged in #159 after a fresh complete small prerequisite
cohort: original input, normalized input and strict output exact/+1 workloads
across all eight public language/API routes. Full results/typed causes, source
and library guards, and normal process closure are retained. Whole-host RSS
includes startup, input handling, public mapping, output retention and host
checks; it establishes neither an API-only peak, a RAM ceiling nor streaming.

The [companion contract](generated-json5-contract.md) separates policy, syntax,
projection, mapping and strict output. Its #154 refresh is merged in
[#161](https://github.com/DeandreT/ferrule/pull/161), including all physical
boundary results and measured whole-host memory ranges. The unassigned
#160 benchmark/report lane will attribute generated C# allocation peaks through
matched profiling and uninstrumented controls, excluding production optimization
and the filesystem multi-output trials in #107. Direct-Program Rust retention
#157 is now merged in #168 after 110 emitter tests, three warnings-denied hosts
and 11 public calls; full validation order is preserved. Native nonfinite
admission #130 is merged in #164 after 190 controls and 58 CLI calls, preserving
the original nullable-reader failure and corrected outcomes. Original-byte/BOM
accounting #163 is merged in #167 after 45 small controls and eight physical
calls. These input-boundary checks make no streaming or total-memory promise.
Unicode identifiers #135 and native metadata #106 remain independent and
available. The initial #96 companion scope is complete and closed. Broader
identifier membership and native/desktop contracts remain separate.

The native #100 increment is merged in #170: seven focused groups and 388 JSON
tests pass, with one existing physical-resource opt-in test ignored. It admits
only the proved required-only object/object-null profile, retains each physical
resource's dialect and ordered presence, and bounds required lists and merged
sets to 256 within that subset. Unsupported shapes/assertions and undeclared new
names still refuse. Generated qualification #169 is merged in
[#174](https://github.com/DeandreT/ferrule/pull/174), completing #100's exact
native/generated acceptance. The finite cohort passes 183 native observations
and all 594 compiled calls: 297 each in Rust and C#, across nine profiles,
16 mappings and 66 cases. Each language passes its full [131, 117, 30, 16, 3]
call vector for generated JSON mappings, independent readers, ordinary typed
execution, typed writers and admission controls. The strict compiled error-order
witness passes on the native #100/#170 and runtime #171/#172 prerequisites.
All 23 owning CLI checks, scoped strict lint and formatting pass. Fourteen
harness controls retain complete originals, including 13 intentional mismatches
and a later valid control. Earlier compiler/nullability and authored expected-text
failures remain preserved separately from the final successful cohort.
The separate #171 direct-runtime correction passed 30 observations and the
affected native/Rust/C# suites. All three hosted #174 jobs completed as failures
without executing any validation step because of the account billing/spending-limit
restriction, as in #170/#172. Local verification, source review and compiled calls
remain distinct from hosted execution.

The #99 browser-history increment is merged in
[#178](https://github.com/DeandreT/ferrule/pull/178) after 43 web tests, fresh
WebAssembly and a separate finite actual browser review: 132 native commands,
34 native GUID-completed downloads and 32 public-helper matches. The two
original helper refusals are preserved; their compact draft originals were
separately qualified by complete-byte comparison. No campaign exit-0 or helper
pass is claimed for those two. The browser/server close calls fulfilled, then
remaining owned descendants needed cleanup before final closure was proven.
Earlier failures remain distinct from this bounded product acceptance. The
#165/#166 missing-binding controls remain prerequisites, without widening the
browser history claim to arbitrary editor or native-desktop parity.

The separate #177 exact coalesced baseline correction is merged in
[#179](https://github.com/DeandreT/ferrule/pull/179), with all 45 web tests, scoped
strict lint and formatting passing. It preserves the strict retained-byte ledger,
transient redo discard and distinct focus sessions; no fresh browser campaign
is claimed. Applied target titles #176 are merged in
[#181](https://github.com/DeandreT/ferrule/pull/181) after 45 web tests, fresh
WebAssembly and 24 actual native browser commands in wide/compact views, with
two complete typed and whole-byte-checked downloads. That owned browser run also
needed descendant cleanup before final closure was proven. Whole-node Fit #180
is merged in [#195](https://github.com/DeandreT/ferrule/pull/195): 54 unique web tests,
12 wide/compact Fit checkpoints, 66 browser commands and two complete verified
downloads pass. It changes only the view transform. Owned descendant cleanup
was required; normal closure was false and final closure was proven. Original
lint, startup and fixture failures remain retained.

The #101 exact String-or-Int IntegerRange contract is merged in
[#183](https://github.com/DeandreT/ferrule/pull/183). Three IR and four native
focused groups, 202 direct calls per language, all 179 C# smoke groups and all
152 compiled generated text/byte calls pass across seven mappings. Full typed,
serialized and refusal oracles cover primary and named boundaries. All 797
affected Rust checks, scoped strict warnings and formatting pass, with one
existing resource test ignored. The original native error-text oracle failure
and its source-reviewed correction remain retained. The optional full generated
catalog was explicitly stopped after early checks and owned cleanup; it is not
claimed passed. Three hosted jobs executed zero steps under the account billing
restriction. String assertions, enum/format behavior and strict Contains remain
separate from integer branch intervals; broader scalar unions are not admitted.
The #107 ordinary filesystem JSON study is merged in
[#185](https://github.com/DeandreT/ferrule/pull/185): eight normal-development-profile
measurements, eight separate verifiers and twelve complete output documents pass.
The [individual-run report](performance/json-output-set-memory.md) records
120.3–194.6 MiB whole-process peaks and all four matched second-output increases:
31.2–39.4 MiB. Both repetitions, full typed/serialized expectations, original
phase/process observations and normal closure remain recorded. The earlier
numeric-parser source finding and its bounded correction are preserved; all 45 numeric
controls pass. Three hosted jobs executed zero validation steps because of the
account billing/spending restriction. Two workloads and two repetitions do not
establish statistical significance, streaming, allocation-exclusive peaks or a
universal RAM cap. The separate #160 generated allocation scope is unchanged.

The ordinary JSON writer #184 is merged in
[#200](https://github.com/DeandreT/ferrule/pull/200). Its ordered private view borrows
ordinary target text and member names rather than constructing a complete owned
`serde_json::Value` tree before pretty rendering. The returned String, APIs,
order, null behavior, coercion, validation/errors and publication stay intact;
container metadata, arbitrary JSON and validation snapshots can still allocate.
All 398 scoped regressions and 126 complete writer-comparison calls pass.
The [matched report](performance/borrowed-json-output-memory.md) preserves the
historical #107 baseline and eight fresh original/candidate fixture comparisons,
with 16 separate verifiers and 24 complete documents. Whole-process peaks are
8.7–40.4 MiB lower for these fixtures only; source/layout/startup/cache differences
limit attribution. No streaming, exclusive allocation saving or RAM cap follows.

The reviewed [scalar sequence design](design/scalar-sequence-composition.md) and
[all 39 proposed literals](design/fixtures/scalar-filter-map-v1.json) are merged
in #102/[#188](https://github.com/DeandreT/ferrule/pull/188). These are 37 feature
cases and two legacy controls; approving a design does not execute them. Model,
codec and private-owner admission #189/#197 pass 1,759 distinct scoped regressions.
Native execution #190/#202 separately passes all 37 feature cases, two legacy
controls and 1,011 distinct regressions. Common lowering #191/#204 passes 62
complete comparisons and 497 library tests, retaining predicate/mapper roots and
transitive UDF callees. Broader nested/higher-order shapes and failure-rule
transform authoring remain outside the initial contract.

Rust #192/#206 passes 188 whole public calls and 30 separately labeled direct
controls across 40 compiled profiles plus seven static/decode controls, with 365
library tests and seven local gates. C# #193/#208 passes 172 public calls across
43 profiles, 35 direct controls, 432 library tests, 179 C# smoke groups and eight
local steps. Complete values, positions, limits, checker boundaries and typed
causes retain their finite public/direct observability scopes. A failed public
mapping does not expose a partial output. Original host/compiler/lint and fixture
failures remain distinct from the corrected cohorts. These results are not GUI,
external-interchange or whole-product qualification.

Ordinary/nested UDF argument ordering #186 is merged in
[#196](https://github.com/DeandreT/ferrule/pull/196): evaluate all raw arguments
left to right before adaptation; all 18 compiled calls per language match frozen
expectations after the original four mismatches per language. Interpreter,
coercion, frame and legacy sequence policy remain unchanged. The separate legacy
Rust aggregate helper-order fix #199 is merged in
[#209](https://github.com/DeandreT/ferrule/pull/209), with 15 independent native
controls, 45 compiled typed/text/byte calls, 114 Rust tests and six local steps.
Its original generated compiler mismatch was observed before the correction.
Earlier hosted sequence jobs did not start under the account billing/spending
restriction; no local result is a hosted pass. Hosted execution later resumed.
All three jobs succeed for #228/#229/#236/#238/#240/#243/#244/#245/#249/#251,
#255/#262/#265/#266/#270/#278/#279/#280/#287 at this scoped snapshot.
Local and hosted checks retain separate records; repeated runs add no distinct cases. #222/#226/#230/#231 retain reached mapping-job failures. #249 merged
at 00:07:26 UTC and #251 at 00:16:28 UTC on 2026-10-10. Successful site builds do not close the Pages
HTTP 404 tracked independently in [#247](https://github.com/DeandreT/ferrule/issues/247).

Compact GUI #194 and guidance #210 are merged in
[#214](https://github.com/DeandreT/ferrule/pull/214). The final 21-role source and
bounded fixture/style corrections are independently accepted. Earlier checks pass
20 focused tests, the complete 742-test GUI suite and 31 web-demo crate tests;
those crate checks are distinct from actual browser UI. Final source passes fresh
strict warnings after 454 required source timestamp refreshes, formatting, one
affected unit check already included in the 742-test suite, and the fresh production build.
Repeated checks do not increase the distinct totals. Earlier compiler, fixture,
strict-lint, timeout and chooser/registration failures remain preserved.

Finite desktop parts observe current-item properties at 1200 × 900 and scope
selection from 900 × 700 to 1200 × 900. Both exit 0 with owned helper cleanup,
which is separate from normal cleanup-free closure. Ordinary editor-driven
identity Rust and C# library generation also exits 0 with owned helper cleanup;
One public String JSON call from each editor-generated identity library matches
the complete independently authored 172-byte golden. The five host commands exit 0
with normal owned closure and no cleanup; this cannot replace the earlier GUI
cleanup observations. All three hosted #214 jobs executed zero validation steps
because of the account billing/spending restriction. These finite observations
do not qualify all 13 physical workflows or all 39 sequence design cases. Constant-7
controls do not prove a real parent frame. Independent document copies are in
scope; same-project duplication is #201.

Desktop Fit #213 is merged in [#238](https://github.com/DeandreT/ferrule/pull/238).
Nine focused Fit tests plus the popup regression, the full 749 GUI tests and fresh
strict/fmt/production build checks pass. Four finite alternate-display parts cover
main/named/single/empty canvases at 900 × 700 and 1200 × 900, preserving complete
saved Project/layout files. GUI process closure is normal; owned private bus
helpers need cleanup. These parts do not qualify every desktop authoring workflow
or browser Fit. Source/model/history and factories/icons remain unchanged.

The earlier two-document refreshes #158/#162, #173/#175, #182/#187 and #212/#215
remain dated records. #212's revised two fences have two SVGs and four PNGs under
the fixed bounds, with owned helper cleanup; its complete map needs zoom. The
unchanged roadmap fence retains its earlier rendered evidence. #252/#255 also
completed its bounded review of the two changed parallel fences. This #336 refresh
preserves every fence body and its historical rendering/zoom/cleanup limits.
The newer ownership and prerequisite relationships are stated in the table and
prose; no fresh or complete-label visual inspection is claimed. No source/link/
diagram check establishes additional product execution.

## Next acceptance gates

- [x] Complete #194's earlier 20 focused/742 GUI/31 web-demo crate checks and final fresh
  strict warnings, formatting, affected unit and production build gates; retain
  original failures and do not double-count repeated checks.
- [x] Observe finite desktop current-item properties and responsive scope selection,
  and generate identity Rust/C# libraries through the editor; owned helper cleanup
  was needed and the broad physical workflow scope is not complete.
- [x] Qualify the two editor-generated identity String JSON host calls against the
  complete 172-byte independent golden, with five normal exit-0 commands and
  cleanup-free owned host closure. Broader saved-input pointer/keyboard, Preview,
  save/reload and history coverage remains separate from this finite increment.
- [x] Qualify #198's 90 native/Rust/C# typed-selection comparisons and owning
  regressions, with complete static admission, global rules once, lazy selected
  loaders and counters; #205's shared C# test-source release is preserved.
- [x] Independently accept #201's public-codec two fixtures / ten Project-layout pairs
  and all 29 modeled policy rows after #290/#294. These are separate from GUI tests.
- [x] Qualify #201's [#309](https://github.com/DeandreT/ferrule/pull/309) candidate
  locally: all 753 GUI tests and strict warnings pass; all 67 native calls match
  60 success and seven typed `MappingException` expectations.
- [x] Complete #316's six independently reviewed desktop phases: 45 complete
  saved Project/layout pairs and 90 byte/JSON comparisons with normal closure.
  Main copy/original/history/context covers 4/6/10/6 pairs; Named
  copy/history and original/context covers 10/9. Earlier failures remain
  retained; native Save/reopen/Save2 and main integration remain pending.
  Preserve #213's Fit hooks, original/copy isolation and history/layout.
- [x] Merge PDF design #329, closing #325, and the wire/library increment #334.
  The 216 local tests, 81 frozen wire cases, strict warnings and formatting pass;
  hosted validation remains pending or unknown.
- [ ] Complete worker host #326, ongoing on `feat/pdf-worker-host`. Initial
  worker/CLI and owned filesystem controls pass; #348 strict-lint correction,
  affected reruns and remaining host failure controls are pending.
- [ ] Add borrowed filesystem reader #344 after #326.
- [ ] Complete GUI filesystem cancellation #327 after #326/#344.
- [ ] Add explicit preview input acquisition #340 after #326/#344.
- [ ] Complete GUI preview ownership #341 after #327/#340.
- [x] Execute resource qualification #328 after #326 as a reproducible
  [resource profile](performance/pdf-worker-resource-profile.md).
  This scope does not depend on #327.
- [x] Materialize and qualify #203's 24 public interpreter observations and 51
  separate typed export refusals; all 237 interchange library tests, strict
  warnings and formatting pass on the fixture candidate. #264's test-only parent
  envelope correction preserves frozen oracles and the original case-8 failure.
- [x] Merge fixture publication #266 after fresh combined-main 24+51 / strict /
  format checks; all three hosted jobs succeed and #264 is closed. External
  save/reopen and faithful-form admission
  remain separate from public Ferrule observations and typed export refusal.
- [x] Qualify #263's 41 simulated controller-policy controls, retaining complete
  exceptions, copies, refusal ordering and exact saved1-path branch. Simulation
  and external owner closure do not establish any real native application call.
- [x] Qualify #268's complete XML oracles: original 68 helper / 17 admission / 41 byte-
  compatibility observations and corrected #283 fresh 41+17 match independent expectations.
  Earlier #263 simulated 41, inherited helper 68 and repeated cohorts remain distinct.
- [x] Publish the neutral checkpoint protocol and retained native negative in #287,
  with three successful hosted jobs; #281 staging and #283 fixture failures are retained.
- [ ] Qualify #263's individually admitted native save/reopen/save2 cycle after exact
  owned-window proof. Native 180-second timeout, #285 diagnostics and #291 presentation refusal
  remain negatives; modeled 16 query checks and helper source do not prove live ownership.
- [x] Qualify #253's focused engine unit controls against #203's published frozen
  fixture: three tests / 11 complete internal observations, all 344 engine tests,
  ordinary engine build and corrected workspace strict/format checks pass locally.
  Public-host observations and borrowed internal records stay separate; construction
  reach is not allocator telemetry and no production getter is introduced.
- [x] Publish #253 with the single test-helper let-chain prerequisite #277 in
  [#278](https://github.com/DeandreT/ferrule/pull/278); all three hosted jobs succeed.
  The original strict-warning failure and both complete focused cohorts are retained;
  repeated runs do not add distinct cases.
- [x] Execute #205's five matched tests and two deliberate comparison-failure
  controls. Full exposed originals remain equal; raw logs are 137,823,450 versus
  124,980 bytes and retained files 876,481 versus 6,110,354 bytes. Two admission logs
  grow. No memory saving or unrecorded old diagnostic detail is inferred.
- [x] Freeze and execute #207's 72 measured native/Rust/C# runs and 72 separate
  complete verifiers. The [report](performance/scalar-sequence-memory.md) retains
  two repetitions, 36 matched pairs and raw/sparse whole-process counter limits.
  Linux guards #242 and composed-workspace packaging #246 are qualified in the
  same increment, merged in #249; all three hosted jobs succeed.
- [x] Complete #248's eight measurements, eight independent output verifiers and
  four trace decoders using #207's merged fixtures, retaining both repetitions.
- [x] Publish #248's bounded [report](performance/csharp-scalar-sequence-profile.md)
  in [#279](https://github.com/DeandreT/ferrule/pull/279), with three successful hosted jobs.
  Source/data and one full rendered diagram are independently reviewed; the 100% viewport requires scrolling. Browser-helper
  cleanup was needed; closure is proven, with normal cleanup-free closure false.
  Samples/stacks are not an exact object ledger, RSS is not allocation attribution,
  and no exact phase clock or capture cause is inferred.
- [x] Qualify #211's same 20 controls and full outcomes; logs change from 538.6 MB
  to 23.6 MB (95.6%). Production behavior and process memory are separate.
- [x] Publish #212's dated two-doc/link/diagram refresh in #215. Historical rendered
  diagrams retain owned cleanup and zoom limitations.
- [x] Qualify #213's complete-rectangle Fit in nine focused tests plus the popup
  regression, all 749 GUI tests and four finite alternate-display main/named/single/
  empty views at 900 × 700 / 1200 × 900; saved Project/layout files remain exact.
- [x] Qualify #217's nine helper controls, three paired regressions, three default
  cleanup repeats and three configuration refusals with one compatible cache.
  Merged in #251 after #249, with all three hosted jobs successful; this does not
  change production behavior.
- [x] Execute #218's frozen 40-recipe/229-call selected JSON contract: 76 native,
  76 Rust and 77 C# calls pass, merged in #262. Actual public returns precede
  separately decoded-wire observations. Preserve the original 15 comparator
  mismatches and the qualified test-only #257 correction.
- [x] Merge the independently source/render-reviewed #261 guide in #270; all three
  hosted jobs and fresh combined-main strict/format checks pass, and #261 is closed.
- [x] Qualify #250's bounded generated C# 004010 options, merged in #265; supplied
  contexts, strict defaults and ordinary typed/JSON APIs remain preserved.
- [ ] Settle #241's explicit competing-feed contract before admission and execution.
- [x] Repair #247's disabled Pages configuration and verify the successful main
  deployment, complete 13-file public readback and landing/docs/default-demo
  observations; [dated evidence and procedure](pages-deployment.md).
- [x] Publish #252's dated two-doc/source/link/render review in #255, with three
  hosted jobs successful; historical diagram cleanup and zoom limits remain.
- [x] Publish #271's dated two-doc status refresh in #280, with three successful hosted jobs.
  Existing fences stay byte-exact; no new rendering or product qualification is inferred.
- [ ] Review and publish #336's scoped main 4d32a3a two-document refresh;
  preserve unrelated lanes and the same historical fences.

## Dependencies and shared areas

A solid arrow below is a prerequisite for the labeled checks. A dotted arrow
means coordinate shared source or verification resources; it does not block
independent design/source work. In particular, generated JSON5 adapters and
native JSON5 metadata are separate contracts, and XML annotations do not have to
finish before JSON5 observation can begin. #100/#170 and #171/#172 are
prerequisites for #169's compiled mapping checks. #99 is the retained history
baseline for #177; #176 precedes #180's applied-title Fit checks. #101 closes only
its exact native/generated profile; #107 supplies #184's matched measurement baseline.
#89 and dated status refreshes coordinate work rather than gate implementation.

The merged #102 contract precedes #189's buildable model/guards, then #190 native
execution and #191 common lowering. #192/#193 separately qualify their languages
on that baseline and the #186 UDF-order policy; #194 native authoring needs the model
and native engine, while backend actions need their respective qualified emitter.
#198's typed-selection qualification is merged independently of GUI implementation.
Its shared C# test-source handoff from #205 preserves complete artifact/error
capture; that release edge is not another backend qualification. #199's predicate
correction remains intact. #218 builds on #198's typed routes; #207/#217 are merged
and release their shared source. #218's 229-call qualification and publication
are complete. The test-only #257 correction is part of that qualification;
#218 → #257 and #218/#257 → #261 describe the guide's prerequisite chain.
#248 uses #207's published fixtures for its accepted finite analysis campaign;
the report is merged in #279; later C# runtime optimization remains a separate scope.

#201's contract/source work is independent, but GUI adoption preserves the released
#194 and #213 hooks. #288 → #201 supplies separately admitted child evidence storage;
#293 → #288 repairs only its late-parent model fixture. #297 → #201 restores the locked
Linux dependency, while #298 → #201 supplies the accepted capture that now compiles.
#300 → #201 restores the ordinary test wire action and undo checkpoint; #301 → #201
corrects the frozen named-context dispatch. The first paired successor's type/module-path
source gaps remain distinct from the actual stale-wire failure. Revised source is
reviewed, applied and formatted; a later invocation refusal precedes compilation.
The 10:53:09 UTC snapshot recorded the corrected selected test passing all ten
admitted cases and 67 local engine previews (61 primary / six named), with review
pending then. The later #309 candidate passes all 753 GUI tests and strict warnings;
its 67 native calls match 60 success/seven typed-error expectations. #316's six
desktop phases are now independently accepted: 45 saved pairs / 90 complete
component comparisons and normal closure. The earlier incomplete named
attempts remain retained. Native Save/reopen/Save2 and main integration remain
pending.
#290 → #201 supplies canonical source guards; #294 → the modeled #290/#201 controls
supplies the missing input and exact copied-fixture/owner bindings. Public-codec two
fixtures / ten pairs and modeled 29 remain separate from GUI duplication and physical
sessions. The first failed unit's nine primary previews remain a distinct historical
cohort; the completed local cohort does not qualify the two physical sessions.
#264 → #203 is the test-fixture prerequisite for the accepted public 24+51 cohort;
it does not alter production position semantics. #203's design admits no faithful
new saved form and does not edit execution/GUI files. #268 → #263 supplies complete
independent XML checkpoint oracles. Original 126 and corrected #283 fresh 58 are accepted;
helper 68 is inherited and earlier #263 simulated 41 stays separate. #281 → #263 repairs
read-only seed staging, and #283 → the affected controls repairs their owned-copy fixture.
The protocol/retained-negative report is merged in #287, but native save/reopen remains
unproved. #285 → #291 supplies bounded diagnostic observations; #291 must prove exact
live application/window ownership before any acknowledgment. Presentation refusal,
completion-dialog images and modeled 16 do not establish causality or a saved cycle.
#302 → #291 blocks retention on post-launch observer exceptions; its source correction
is accepted and three new mocked exception models match the independently accepted
root-owned run. Fresh query16 and live observer/query qualification
remain pending; no worker/thread/finally closure is inferred from the mocked branch.
#211 and #213 have completed their separate test-only/view-only increments.
#253's internal engine-unit lane depends on #203's published frozen fixture and
keeps complete internal observations separate from public saved-design results.
Its narrow test-only sink changes no public API, budgets or execution policy.
The explicit #277 → #253 publication dependency is the single let-chain condition
in the capture test helper; both are merged in #278 with three successful hosted jobs.
It remains a prerequisite relationship, not shared-resource coordination.
#217's merged PR followed #207's publication because they share a parent/source handoff,
not because memory results supply a host-policy contract. #242/#246 are bounded
parts of #207. #250/#265 is merged on the admitted raw X12 #221 and native ISA #224 boundaries;
#241 distinguishes competing feeds from #239's declared ancestor branches.
#233 metadata inspection and #103's typed query contract remain separate.

#325's PDF isolation design is merged in #329, followed by the wire/library
increment #334. Worker host #326 builds on that contract. Borrowed reader #344
follows #326 and supplies GUI filesystem cancellation #327 and preview
acquisition #340. GUI preview ownership #341 follows #327/#340. Resource
qualification #328 depends on #326 and remains independent of GUI work.
Fixture/source preparation can proceed while the host is in progress, but #328's
82 planned requests remain unrun.

#212/#215, #252/#255, #271/#280 and #299 are dated documentation records.
#336's earlier refresh merged in #337. #349 updates these two files against
main 6b94863 for completed desktop qualification and current PDF dependencies;
the older publication observations retain their 10:53:09 UTC snapshot date.
The Pages #247 workflow repair is independent of mapping implementation and these docs.
The existing diagrams below remain historical dependency views from #252;
their solid arrows are prerequisites and dotted arrows coordinate shared files
or resources without preventing independent source work.

The current PDF implementation lanes use separate file ownership. A solid
arrow means the upstream API must be ready; fixture preparation and source
review can proceed in parallel. All nodes below remain open implementation or
qualification work, and resource qualification gates later default activation.

The compact view below remains the earlier #252 graph. The current table and
explicit prose dependencies above are authoritative for the additional lanes;
the historical graph is not a current completion map. #253 depends on
#203's frozen fixture, whose design lane is outside this compact view; that edge
is explicit in the complete map below.

</details>

Shared-file changes need explicit coordination even when the issues are otherwise
independent. Examples include app/workspace and test registrations, the workbook
draft, the JSON Schema facade, generated runtime/adapter modules, and CLI input
or artifact staging. Record a bounded file/function ownership split or sequence
the edits; preserve the other issue's complete behavior and tests.

## Verification resources

- Reserve one build lane when contributors share Cargo artifacts. Check disk
  space before and after substantial builds, reuse compatible caches, and use
  bounded jobs and incremental settings. See [Development](development.md#build-space-and-desktop-isolation).
- Reserve graphical or external-application sessions separately. Use an alternate
  display and an isolated chooser/session route; never drive another contributor's
  process or the user's active desktop. Bind the executable to the tested source
  and retain owned process closure, including failed attempts.
- Keep source review, focused local tests, generated public-host calls, normal
  desktop interactions, external execution and memory trials distinct. A source
  review or an emission pass does not close an execution gate.
- Measurements need their own finite input/profile/trial plan and full output
  checks. An observed peak is not a universal RAM limit or a streaming promise.

## Complete or hand off

A PR should describe the concrete resulting behavior, link the issue and record
which acceptance checks ran, with evidence or a precise blocker for checks still
open. Update only the corresponding roadmap/conformance gate after its required
evidence exists. Preserve earlier failures and narrower supported profiles.

The [conformance inventory](../conformance/README.md) remains incomplete. Do not
rewrite the protected survey as part of ordinary feature or coordination work,
mark unknown cells supported, or infer whole-product parity from a local cohort.
The coverage index in #95 keeps helper-only and compiled public-route evidence
separate; #133 records the completed #116–#119 slices without closing every XML
gap. Design-only #102 ends with an agreed follow-on plan rather than unreviewed
code.
